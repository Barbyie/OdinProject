            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon paprika </li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 pinch garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 pinch onion powder</li>

        <ol><div class="list-color">
            <li>Arrange potatoes evenly on a microwave-safe plate. Microwave on high until just 
                tender, about 4 minutes. Let cool to room temperature. Cut potatoes into bite-sized chunks.</li>
            <li>Heat butter and olive oil in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until 
                butter melts and starts to turn brown. Swirl the pan and add potatoes; 
                shake the pan to arrange in an even layer. Season with paprika, cayenne, garlic powder, 
                onion powder, salt, and pepper.</li>
            <li>Continue to toss potatoes and cook until reddish-brown, crusty, and crispy on the 
                edges, 10 to 12 minutes. If potatoes are cooking too quickly, reduce the heat 
                to medium. Garnish with chives.</li>
