        <p><em><font size="-1">Russian dish made of pieces of beef combined with a sauce made of mustard</font></em></p>
        <p>From its origins in mid-19th-century Russia, it has become popular around the world, 
        with considerable variation from the original recipe. Mushrooms are common in many variants.</p>

        it consists of strips of beef filet with a mushroom, onion, and sour cream sauce, 
        and is served over rice or noodles.</p>
